## Donetick Frontend

The Donetick Frontend is Frontend piece for Donetick written in javascript with React

## What is Donetick?

An open-source, user-friendly app for managing tasks and chores, featuring customizable options to help you and others stay organized.

## Why I made Donetick?

As an avid for open-source, I was eager to create a solution that could benefit the wider community. Donetick started as a personal project to address my own chore management needs, but it has evolved into bigger tool and decide to open source it for anyone seeking a customizable and privacy-focused task management tool

## Features

- Task and Chore Management: Easily create, edit, and manage tasks and chores for yourself or your group.
- Shared To-Do Lists: Create "Circles" to collaborate on tasks with family or your group
- Assignee Assignment: Assign tasks to specific individuals or rotate them automatically using customizable strategies.
- Recurring Tasks: Schedule tasks to repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, with flexible customization options.
- Progress Tracking: Track the completion status of tasks and view historical data.

## Need Help:

Donetick is a work in progress and has been a fantastic learning experience for me as I've honed my React skills,I'm looking for collaborators to help improve and refine the Donetick. Feel free to open PR or suggest changes.

## Plans :

My goal is to expand Donetick by offering a hosted infrastructure option. This will make it even easier for users to access and utilize Donetick's features without the need for self-hosting.

While maintaining Donetick's commitment to open source, this hosted option will provide a seamless, out-of-the-box experience for those who prefer a managed solution.
