      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
          ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
          periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a
          monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan
          you select when purchasing a Subscription.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
          renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Favoro
          cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
          your online account management page or by contacting Donetickcustomer
          support team.

        <li>
          A valid payment method, including credit or debit card, is required to
          process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Favoro
          with accurate and complete billing information including full name,
          address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method
          information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically
          authorize Donetickto charge all Subscription fees incurred through
          your account to any such payment instruments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Donetickwill
          issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually,
          within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to
          the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
